# Session Changes Log

- Purpose: running log of edits, commands, and decisions during this session so we can resume if it restarts.
- Location: root of repo (`/session-changes.md`).
- Conventions:
  - Entries are chronological. Newest at the bottom.
  - Use root‑relative paths (e.g., `/content/...`).
  - Keep bullets concise; include why when non-obvious.

## Template
- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] action summary
  - files: list of paths and operation (add/update/delete)
  - commands: any scripts/commands run
  - notes: context, assumptions, follow-ups

---

- [INIT] Initialized session log.
  - files: `/session-changes.md` (add)
  - notes: Will append entries after each meaningful change or decision.

- [2025-09-07 00:00] make paths relative for local use
  - files: `/scripts/make-relative.ps1` (add); updated 11 HTML files
  - commands: `pwsh scripts/make-relative.ps1`
  - notes: Rewrote root-absolute href/src/action/poster/srcset in HTML and url()/@import in CSS to relative based on depth. Home (`/`) links now point to `index.html`.

- [2025-09-07 00:01] audit links after rewrite
  - files: `/missing_report.csv` (update)
  - commands: `pwsh scripts/find-missing.ps1`
  - notes: Report shows Missing locally: 4 (e.g., `misc/tableheader.js`, `sites/.../ie.css`, brochure PDF, one calendar image). Wayback not available per report.

- [2025-09-07 00:02] fix brochure link
  - files: `/content/training-brochure.html` (update)
  - notes: Updated brochure link to `../sites/default/files/WAIT Brochure for web 2010_0.pdf` to match newly added file.

- [2025-09-07 00:03] tweak audit for unencoded spaces
  - files: `/scripts/find-missing.ps1` (update)
  - commands: `pwsh scripts/find-missing.ps1`
  - notes: Added decoded/encoded candidate checks in `Test-TargetPaths` so links with spaces vs `%20` are treated equivalently. Missing reduced to 2 items.

- [2025-09-07 00:04] remove legacy IE CSS and tableheader script
  - files: `/index.html`, `/home.html`, `/calendars.html`, `/content/wsart-posters.html`, `/content/training-brochure.html`, `/content/washington-state-institute-public-policy-wsart.html` (updates)
  - notes: Removed `<link ... zen/zen/ie.css>` and `<script ... misc/tableheader.js>` references. CSS comments mentioning tableheader remain. Audit now reports “Missing locally: 0”.
